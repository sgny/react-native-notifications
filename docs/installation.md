# Installation

As with any React Native project, the first step is to add the project as an npm dependency.

The 2nd is to do some setup so as to be able to work with Apple services for push notifications.

Start by running this:

```
$ npm install react-native-notifications --save
```

First, [Manually link](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#manual-linking) the library to your Xcode project.

Then, to enable notifications support add the following line at the top of your `AppDelegate.m`

```objective-c
#import "RNNotifications.h"
```

And the following methods to support registration and receiving notifications:

```objective-c
// Required to register for notifications
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:(UIUserNotificationSettings *)notificationSettings
{
  [RNNotifications didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken
{
  [RNNotifications didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error {
  [RNNotifications didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
}

// Required for the notification event.
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)notification {
  [RNNotifications didReceiveRemoteNotification:notification];
}

// Required for the localNotification event.
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification
{
  [RNNotifications didReceiveLocalNotification:notification];
}
```
